#6. del => used to delete an object in Python
name = ['Ben', 'Nick', 'Veni']
del name[1]
print (name) #output => ['Ben','Veni']

#✨ more ✨
#name => variable (don't use reserved words to be a variable. Because of it can make you get a problem)
#[] (Index brackets) => allowing you to declare a list and its contents in your program, or a reserved memory location to store values
#the way [] (index brackets) read are 0,1,2,3
#for example => ['Ben','Nick','Veni'] = ['0','1','2']
#so, when we ask operator to del name in order '1', definitely, it would take 'Nick' out of the list.
